# Supersonic-rocket-control-system
This is a project to create a low cost vector thrusting for a supersonic rocket.
As of 01/24/2016 I only have a Gyroscope and Servos working.
Next step is to design and analyze the dynamics of the rocket and program it to respond accordingly.

This project is written around Raspberry pi 2 with RASPBIAN JESSIE LITE as OS.
Llibrary used for servo control is called ServoBlaster found at: https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits
